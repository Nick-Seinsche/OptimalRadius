# üåø Optimal Radius of Leaves

This repository contains a mathematical and computational study exploring how leaves curve based on their internal layered structure. The project is based on a **nonlinear multi-layer bending model**, inspired by studies on curled nanotubes, and adapted to biological leaf structures.

## üß™ Overview

Leaves often curve due to differential growth or contraction in their layers. This project explores the **optimal radius of curvature** that a leaf adopts by minimizing the energy functional derived from elasticity theory. The underlying physics is captured through isotropic assumptions for each layer and integrated into a dimensionally-reduced bending energy model.

## üß† Mathematical Model

We compute the optimal curvature `Œ∫*` by minimizing the quadratic form:

$$\kappa^* = \argmin_{\kappa} \overline{Q}_2(\kappa \cdot e_1)$$

$\overline{Q}_2$ can be seen as
the dimensionally reduced linearized energy functional at the identity, which is derived from isotropic elasticity model across two layers, incorporating:

- Layer mismatches (B)

- Thickness and aspect ratios (d, h)

- Lam√© parameters derived from Young's modulus and Poisson ratio

The predicted radius is then given by:

$$r = \frac{d}{(h \cdot |\kappa^*|)}$$

Full details are found in one page theory.pdf.
